# Simulation-Based-Validation-of-9-Qubit-Shor-Quantum-Error-Correction-Code
This paper presents a simulation-based study of the 9-qubit Shor quantum error correction code. Fault-tolerant logical operations, exhaustive single-qubit error recovery, and statevector validation are analyzed using Qiskit simulators under ideal and noisy conditions.
